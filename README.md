# AMRNet

_AMRNet_ is designed to predict steady flows from signed distance functions (SDF). 
Follwoing the landmarking work by [Guo et al](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/2939672.2939738), 
we extend the CNN prediction model to be applicable to the flow fields based on adaptive meshes. 
For this purpose, we employ the [pix2pixHD](https://github.com/NVIDIA/pix2pixHD) based network to handle the data with multiple resolutions. 

# Usage

## Installation
This code relies on the following packages. As a deeplearing framework, we use [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org).
- Install  
[numpy](https://numpy.org), [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org), [xarray](http://xarray.pydata.org/en/stable/) and [netcdf4](https://github.com/Unidata/netcdf4-python)

- Clone this repo  
```git clone https://github.com/yasahi-hpc/AMRNet.git```


## Prepare dataset
The dataset can be downloaded from [Dataset]().
